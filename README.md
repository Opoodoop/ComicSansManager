# Comic Sans Manager

> The font nobody asked for, but everyone deserves.

Comic Sans Manager is the pinnacle of font management sophistication—a carefully crafted batch script (yes, batch!) that boldly replaces your Windows 10/11 system fonts with the typographical icon that is Comic Sans MS. Whether you're trying to annoy a coworker, prank a friend, or just need a daily reminder that chaos is beautiful, this project has your back.

Forget Helvetica. Forget Segoe UI. Comic Sans is here to bring levity and a touch of informal whimsy to the otherwise sterile and joyless wasteland that is your operating system interface.

## Features

This project doesn’t just slap Comic Sans on your screen—it does so responsibly. Here’s a breakdown of what makes Comic Sans Manager the future of systems font modification:

- 🗂 Automatic Backup Creation:
  On first launch, the script will automagically create a backup of your system fonts in a .reg file. This means you can restore your dignity at any point.

- 🧙‍♂️ Interactive CLI Wizardry:
  Prompts! Text! Arrows! Input options! Everything a good ol’ Windows batch script should have. It asks you questions and expects answers like it’s 1998.

- 📝 Easily Auditable Registry Edits:
  All changes are stored in staged.reg for maximum transparency. Want to know what the script is doing to your registry? Crack open that file and gaze into the abyss.

- 🔄 One-Step Uninstall:
  Simply run the script again and it’ll offer to restore your old fonts from the backup. Yes, even Comic Sans respects your freedom of choice.

- 🛑 Tamper Warning:
  If you lose the backup, that’s on you, buddy. We warned you. In **bold. Twice**.

- Creates a backup at first launch
- easy to use prompt for install and uninstalling
- installs the system fonts easily auditable from the staged.reg file
- uninstalls by loading the backup created at first launch

⚠️ Remember to keep the backup secure for easy restoring

## Installation

1. Download the batch script.

2. Double-click it (because we love living dangerously).

3. Follow the on-screen instructions and let the magic happen.

4. Reboot your computer.

5. Bask in the glory of Comic Sans on your system dialogs, error messages, and login screens.

- Reconsider your life choices (optional but recommended).

## Important Warning That Sounds Official

This tool modifies your Windows registry. While it's designed to be safe and reversible, any tool that messes with fonts at a system level could cause irreversible trauma to your design sensibilities. We are not liable for:

- Broken UI layouts.

- Graphic designers crying.

- Friends disowning you.

- The Department of Aesthetics revoking your license.

## Why Comic Sans?

Because it’s time we embraced absurdity. Comic Sans represents freedom. Rebellion. A quirky refusal to take things too seriously in a world obsessed with order and typographical hierarchy. Installing it as your system font is a statement—one that says "I choose chaos, but in a fun way."
